## ⚠️ Not Implemented (Optional)

- [ ] Add optional AI-generated descriptions

**Note**: The AI-generated descriptions feature was marked as optional bonus content. It would require integration with a vision AI service like OpenAI GPT-4V, Google Vision API, or similar. This could be added as a future enhancement.

## 🚀 Application Features

- **Modal image viewer** with larger view and metadata display
- **Loading states** with skeleton placeholders
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Professional UI** with hover effects and smooth animations

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application works seamlessly across devices:
